# Cortex devtools

A [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cortex-devtools/fpiekoekdbcomggnffgallmgbcmllhgh) to debug the code

It is currently working with web projects but not working yet for distant devices (React Native), it should be released in the next weeks

Add the flag debug `true` to the core options

```ts
export const Core = createCortexFactory()(services);

const core = new Core({}, { debugger: true })
```
