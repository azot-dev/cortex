# useMethod

Useful for async services, it returns the state of the promise
and executes automatically when the component where it is encapsulated first renders

It is similar to the `react-query` and `apollo-graphql` hooks behavior
but since the complete async logic will be encapsulated in one service method, no need to listen in a useEffect or a useMemo a query to finish, the useMethod just wraps a complete use case and generates the data useful for the UI (in most of the cases no need to store a isLoading boolean in the store)

```tsx
export const ShoesComponent = () => {
const shoesService = useService('shoes')
const {
  isLoading,
  isError,
  isSuccess,
  isCalled,
  error,
  call,
  data,
} = useMethod(shoesService.load)

if (!isCalled || !isLoading) {
  return <Loader>
}

if (isError) {
  return <span>An error occured</span>
}

return <Shoes data={data}>
}
```
