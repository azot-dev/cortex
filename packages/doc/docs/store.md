# Store

The store is based on [legend app state](https://legendapp.com/open-source/state/)

The most you have to know is that every node of your store can be modified using `set()` and accessed using `get()`.

Each service has a local state accessible from itself

```ts
type State = { count: number };

export class CounterService extends Service<State> {
  static initialState: State = { count: 0 };

// highlight-start
  increment() {
    this.state.count.set((count) => count + 1);
  }
 // highlight-end
}
```

The global store is accessible using the instantiated Cortex object

```ts
const core = new Core()

const count = core.counter.count.get()
```

For further technical information you can refer to the official [documentation](https://legendapp.com/open-source/state/)
