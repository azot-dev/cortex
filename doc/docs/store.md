# Store

The store is based on [legend app state](https://legendapp.com/open-source/state/)

The most you have to know is that every node of your store can be modified using `set()` and accessed using `get()`.
The store must be modified ONLY inside the services methods.

For further technical information you car refer to the official [documentation](https://legendapp.com/open-source/state/)
